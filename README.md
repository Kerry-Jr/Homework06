# Project Description

Created a simple weather app using openweather.com weather api.  Utilizing .ajax I created a weather app that accepts city and state and then display's current day with temp, windspeed, humidity.

# Installation

The application uses the following: jQuery, Javascript, HTML, CSS, local Storage, and Moment.js.

# Usage

The application is located here: [Weather App](https://kerry-jr.github.io/weatherApp/). In order to use this application users will input a city and state into the correct fields and then hit search. The application uses openweather API. The application will then provide the user with a 5-day forecast, current day, and other metrics that describe the weather.
